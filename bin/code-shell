# this file is used as my integrated terminal in vscode, and it allows me to use tmux sessions in vscode.
# it creates the sessions based on a syntax of [vscode-(pwd with slashes replaced with dashes)]
# PREFIX+s can be used to switch between these sessions as well, allow for easy access to specific sessions whenever I want.
